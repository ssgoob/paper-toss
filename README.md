#Papertoss
Papertoss, inspired by the culture-forming game of trashketball from the 90’s classic Office Space, uses technology to develop a unified, inter-office culture flow. Through its pairing algorithm, Papertoss randomizes conversation partners across departments and geographical office locations. It creates serendipitous meetings and invites people, who may otherwise have no reason for interaction, to become more aware of the small aspects of their colleagues’ lives - shared details that can have huge effects in the efficiency and humanity of their future collaboration. Furthermore, Papertoss provides an appropriate environment in which to socialize constructively, ultimately nurturing a more fluid collaboration across distributed workspaces. Our suggested questions demonstrate the understanding that familiarity lies in shared experiences - “Have you seen this HackerNews article?” It lies in the mundane - “What did you eat for breakfast today?” In our global marketplace, as distributed workplaces become the norm rather than the exception, it becomes ever more important, for employee satisfaction and for bottom line, to orchestrate these micro-interactions.
