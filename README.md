# Papertoss

Papertoss, inspired by the classic 90s game, uses technology to develop a unified, inter-office cultural flow. Through its matching algorithm, Papertoss randomizes conversations across departments and office locations. It creates serendipitous meetings and invites employees, who may not otherwise interact, to get to know their colleagues as people. Furthermore, Papertoss provides an appropriate environment in which to socialize constructively, ultimately nurturing a more fluid collaboration across distributed workspaces. Our suggested questions demonstrate the understanding that familiarity lies in shared experiences - “Have you seen this HackerNews article?” And it lies in the mundane - “What did you eat for breakfast today?” In our global marketplace, as distributed workplaces become the norm rather than the exception, it becomes ever more important, for employee satisfaction and for the bottom line, to orchestrate these micro-interactions.

Possible add-ons and improvements include a Slack integration or web-browser plug-in to maximize productivity, a video-chatting feature to communicate non-verbal cues, and gamification to encourage and reward employee participation.
